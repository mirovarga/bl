A simple static blog generator written in Haskell. It's basically a rewrite of
[LitePub](https://github.com/mirovarga/litepub).

> **NB**: Currently it just serves as a playground for writing my first real
  project in Haskell and therefore is tailored to generating my
  [blog](https://mirovarga.com).
