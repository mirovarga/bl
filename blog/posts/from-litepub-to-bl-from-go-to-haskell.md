## The Short Story

Starting yesterday, I generate this blog with [bl](https://github.com/mirovarga/bl)
instead of [LitePub](https://github.com/mirovarga/litepub).

## The Longer Story

I've been learning, (or trying to learn), Haskell for several years now and
finally decided to write something real in it. That something is
[bl](https://github.com/mirovarga/bl) - a simple static
blog generator.

It's basically a rewrite of [LitePub](https://github.com/mirovarga/litepub) and
currently just serves as a playground for writing my first real project in
Haskell.

So to test it in production, yesterday I migrated this blog to **bl** :-)
